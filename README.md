- given two inputs, construct a fibonacci sequence
- run `npm test` will output the following:

```
    ✓ generateFibonacciSequence with initial state: {} returns {1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765} (7ms)
    ✓ generateFibonacciSequence with initial state: {1,2} returns {1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946}
    ✓ generateFibonacciSequence with initial state: {1,4} returns {1,4,5,9,14,23,37,60,97,157,254,411,665,1076,1741,2817,4558,7375,11933,19308}
    ✓ generateFibonacciSequence with initial state: {2,3} returns {2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946,17711}
